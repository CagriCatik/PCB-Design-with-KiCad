The schematic and printed circuit board (PCB) layout are designed with simplicity to facilitate the learning process for users new to KiCad. The finalized PCB design is characterized by its compact form factor and strategic component placement: the LED is situated at the front to optimize light emission, the switch is positioned for ergonomic thumb access, and the coin cell battery holder is centrally located to ensure mechanical stability.
