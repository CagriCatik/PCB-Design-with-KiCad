## Course Overview

This guide is structured around the **Udemy Course** taught by **Dr. Peter Dalmaris**, offering a detailed, step-by-step journey through the PCB design process. Through hands-on, project-based learning, you'll gain expertise in:

- The complete PCB design workflow, from concept to production.
- Creating and managing schematics in KiCad.
- Associating schematic symbols with PCB footprints.
- Crafting professional PCB layouts.
- Mastering essential PCB design concepts such as edge cuts, copper pours, mounting holes, traces, solder masks, and silkscreen.
- Deep familiarity with KiCad's interface, tools, configurations, and project management.

## Key Topics

### 1. PCB Design Process
- Step-by-step guide to designing single, double, and multi-layer PCBs.
- Understanding key PCB concepts: edge cuts, mounting holes, traces, and more.

### 2. Schematic Design
- Creating and managing schematics using KiCad's powerful schematic editor.
- Associating schematic symbols with their corresponding footprints.

### 3. PCB Layout Design
- Best practices for creating professional-grade PCB layouts.
- Implementing advanced techniques: copper fills, solder masks, silkscreens, and precise component placement.

### 4. Mastering KiCad Tools
- Detailed breakdown of KiCad’s apps, toolbars, and menus.
