# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1 Overview of KiCad as a PCB Design Tool**
KiCad is a powerful open-source software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). It is widely used for creating schematics and printed circuit board (PCB) layouts. With its robust set of tools, KiCad allows engineers and hobbyists to design complex PCBs, from simple single-layer boards to advanced multi-layer designs. The software supports a wide range of features, including schematic capture, PCB layout, 3D visualization, and generation of manufacturing files. KiCad is particularly popular in the maker and IoT communities due to its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and active development community.

In this tutorial, we will explore the capabilities of KiCad 7 by designing a fully functional IoT device based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The project will cover the entire design workflow, from initial specification to generating manufacturing files.
