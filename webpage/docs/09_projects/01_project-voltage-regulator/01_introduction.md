# Introduction

Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are the foundation of modern electronics, providing the platform for connecting and supporting electronic components. This guide focuses on the process of designing your first PCB, using a simple voltage regulator circuit as an example. The goal is to provide a clear, practical, and beginner-friendly introduction to PCB design, enabling you to create a functional board in less than 10 minutes.

## Overview of PCB Design Process

Designing a PCB involves two primary stages:

1. **Creating the Schematic Diagram**: The schematic is the blueprint of your circuit. It visually represents the electronic components, their connections, and their relationships within the circuit. This step is critical because it lays the foundation for the PCB design.

2. **Developing the PCB Layout**: The PCB layout is the physical representation of your circuit, which involves arranging components on a board and routing the electrical connections between them. This stage transforms the schematic into a manufacturable design.

By breaking the process into these two stages, you can methodically approach PCB design, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Example: Simple Voltage Regulator Circuit

To illustrate the PCB design process, we will create a simple voltage regulator circuit. This project involves designing a PCB for a Texas Instruments TPS793 linear voltage regulator. The circuit takes a 5V input and outputs 3.3V, capable of supporting a load of up to 200mA. The board also includes LEDs to indicate input and output voltage, making it both functional and visually intuitive.

### Key Features of the Design:
- **Input Voltage**: 5V
- **Output Voltage**: 3.3V
- **Current Capacity**: Up to 200mA
- **Components**:
  - A Texas Instruments TPS793 linear voltage regulator.
  - Capacitors for input, output, and noise reduction (bypass).
  - LEDs with current-limiting resistors for input and output voltage indication.
  - Connectors for input and output voltage.

## Importance of a Well-Designed PCB

A PCB not only holds the electronic components in place but also ensures reliable electrical connections between them. Poor PCB design can lead to issues such as noise, power loss, and unreliable performance. By following a structured design process, you can create PCBs that are:
- **Efficient**: Optimized for electrical performance.
- **Reliable**: Free from design flaws and errors.
- **Easy to Manufacture**: Using standard components and layouts.

This guide focuses on creating a simple yet robust PCB, balancing functionality with ease of assembly.
