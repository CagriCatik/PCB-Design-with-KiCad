# 10. Net Classes & BOM

## 10.1 Net Class Definition and Routing Rules

Net classes are integral to enforcing specific electrical and physical constraints within PCB designs, ensuring signal integrity, manufacturability, and adherence to performance specifications. By categorizing critical signal groups into distinct net classes, designers can apply tailored routing rules that address the unique requirements of each signal type. This section delineates the definition and routing rules for various net classes utilized in the STM32 WB55CEU-based Bluetooth PCB design.

### 10.1.1 RF Net Class

The RF net class is designated for high-frequency signal paths, such as RF_OUT and antenna matching networks, which are pivotal for maintaining signal integrity in wireless communication applications.

- **Scope:**  
  - RF traces including RF_OUT and components forming the antenna matching networks.

- **Rules:**  
  - **Impedance:**  
    - Maintained at 50 Ω ±10%, achieved through the use of coplanar waveguide (CPW) configurations.  
    - Trace specifications include a width of 0.3 mm and a gap of 0.15 mm to the ground plane, ensuring controlled impedance essential for high-frequency signal transmission.
  
  - **Isolation:**  
    - A clearance of at least three times the trace width (0.9 mm) is enforced from adjacent digital signals.  
    - This isolation mitigates electromagnetic interference (EMI) and prevents cross-talk, which could degrade RF performance.

  - **Via Usage:**  
    - Prohibited between components of the π-network and the antenna to prevent inductive discontinuities and maintain a continuous signal path.

- **Validation:**  
  - **Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR):**  
    - Employed to verify the impedance continuity along RF traces, ensuring deviations do not exceed 5%.  
    - This validation technique identifies and quantifies impedance mismatches that could lead to signal reflections and loss of integrity.

### 10.1.2 USB Net Class

The USB net class manages the differential signaling required for USB data transmission, ensuring robust and high-fidelity communication between the microcontroller and connected host devices.

- **Scope:**  
  - Differential pairs comprising D+ and D– lines.

- **Rules:**  
  - **Impedance:**  
    - Maintained at 90 Ω differential ±10%, facilitated by traces with a width of 0.2 mm and spacing of 0.1 mm.  
    - Controlled impedance is critical for minimizing signal reflections and maintaining data integrity at USB 2.0 speeds.
  
  - **Length Matching:**  
    - Intra-pair skew must not exceed 5 mils, ensuring that the D+ and D– signals arrive simultaneously at the receiver, which is essential for accurate differential signal interpretation.

  - **Routing:**  
    - Bends in USB traces should avoid 90° angles; instead, 45° miters or arcs are employed to reduce impedance discontinuities and signal reflections.  
    - This approach preserves the integrity of high-speed differential signals, ensuring reliable data transmission.

- **Validation:**  
  - **Eye Diagram Analysis:**  
    - Conducted to assess the quality of the differential signals, with a requirement of ≥70% eye opening at 12 Mbps.  
    - A clear eye opening indicates minimal jitter and noise, signifying robust signal integrity conducive to high-speed data communication.

### 10.1.3 Power Net Class

The power net class encompasses all voltage rails supplying power to various components, ensuring stable and efficient power distribution across the PCB.

- **Scope:**  
  - Voltage rails including 3V3, 5V, and VBAT.

- **Rules:**  
  - **Trace Width:**  
    - Power traces are dimensioned based on current capacity requirements:  
      - 3V3 rails utilize traces with a width of 0.5 mm, supporting currents up to 1A.  
      - 5V rails employ wider traces of 0.8 mm to accommodate higher currents up to 2A.
  
  - **Via Current:**  
    - Each via is limited to a maximum current of 1A.  
    - For high-current paths, multiple vias are employed in parallel to distribute the load and prevent overheating or excessive voltage drops.

- **Validation:**  
  - **IR Drop Analysis:**  
    - Ensures that voltage drops across power traces do not exceed 3% of the nominal voltage at maximum load conditions.  
    - This analysis guarantees that all components receive adequate voltage, maintaining operational stability and performance.

### 10.1.4 SWD Net Class

The SWD (Serial Wire Debug) net class facilitates debugging and programming functionalities, providing a dedicated pathway for SWDIO, SWCLK, SWO, and NRST signals.

- **Scope:**  
  - Debug signals including SWDIO, SWCLK, SWO, and NRST.

- **Rules:**  
  - **Trace Width:**  
    - Maintained at 0.25 mm (10 mil), ensuring sufficient bandwidth for debugging operations without excessive resistance or inductance.
  
  - **Guard Traces:**  
    - A ground trace with a spacing of 0.3 mm is routed on both sides of the SWD traces.  
    - This shielding minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) from adjacent signals, preserving the integrity of debug communications.

  - **Length:**  
    - SWD traces must not exceed 30 mm from the microcontroller to the Tag Connect header.  
    - Short trace lengths reduce signal degradation and latency, ensuring timely and accurate debugging operations.

- **Validation:**  
  - **Signal Integrity Simulation:**  
    - Performed to verify that the rise time of SWD signals does not exceed 5 ns at a clock frequency of 10 MHz.  
    - This simulation ensures that the debug signals maintain their intended waveform characteristics, preventing data corruption during high-speed communication.
