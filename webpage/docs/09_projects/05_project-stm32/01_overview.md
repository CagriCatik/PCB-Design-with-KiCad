## 1.3 Design Flow

The design flow for the STM32 WB55CEU-based Bluetooth board encompasses several critical stages, including schematic design, PCB layout, and manufacturing, each meticulously executed to achieve a high-performance and reliable final product.

### 1.3.1 Schematic Design

The schematic design phase prioritizes robust power distribution, efficient RF subsystem integration, and a stable clock system. Power distribution is managed through a 3.3V regulation circuit utilizing the MIC5365-3.3YD Low Dropout Regulator (LDO), capable of supplying up to 150 mA with a maximum input voltage of 5.5V. To support low-power modes, a Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) configuration is implemented, incorporating a 10 µH inductor and a 4.7 µF output capacitor, which collectively enhance power efficiency and reduce energy consumption during idle states.

Decoupling is addressed through a strategic topology that includes 100 nF Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCC) placed at each VDD pin to filter high-frequency noise, complemented by a 1 µF bulk capacitor situated at the VDDA pin to stabilize the analog supply voltage. This approach ensures minimal voltage ripple and enhances overall power integrity across the board.

The RF subsystem is meticulously designed with a π-network matching circuit tailored for the 2.4 GHz BLE frequency. The network consists of 0.8 pF, 2.7 nH, and 0.3 pF components, which collectively optimize impedance matching and minimize signal reflections. The UFL footprint, specifically the Hirose U.FL connector, is integrated with ground-plane stitching to mitigate EMI, thereby ensuring clean and reliable wireless communication.

Clock system stability is achieved through the incorporation of a 32 MHz MEMS oscillator (NX3225GD) paired with 10 pF load capacitors, providing a precise and stable reference for the microcontroller’s operations. Additionally, a 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator (NX2012SA) supports the RTC and low-power modes, facilitating accurate timekeeping and efficient power management during periods of reduced activity.

### 1.3.2 PCB Layout

The PCB layout adheres to a four-layer stackup configuration, comprising Top, Ground (GND), Power (PWR), and Bottom layers, constructed using an FR-4 substrate with a relative permittivity (εᵣ) of 4.5. The inclusion of a 0.2 mm prepreg layer serves to minimize interlayer capacitance, which is crucial for maintaining signal integrity in high-frequency circuits.

Critical routing paths are designed with precision to ensure optimal performance:

- **RF Trace**: Implemented as a 50Ω coplanar waveguide with a width of 0.3 mm and a gap of 0.15 mm on the Top layer, the RF trace is engineered to support high-frequency signal transmission with minimal loss and reflection.
  
- **USB D+/D– Lines**: Routed as 90Ω differential pairs with a trace width of 0.2 mm and a spacing of 0.1 mm, these lines are designed to maintain differential signaling integrity, reducing susceptibility to external noise and ensuring compliance with USB 2.0 standards.

- **SWD Signals**: The Serial Wire Debug (SWD) signals are routed with a trace width of 10 mils and are flanked by guard traces. This configuration enhances noise immunity, protecting the integrity of programming and debugging signals from electromagnetic interference.

### 1.3.3 Manufacturing (PCBWay)

The manufacturing process is conducted through PCBWay, adhering to stringent fabrication standards to ensure high-quality output:

- **Gerber Files**: The design is translated into layer-specific Gerber files, encompassing copper layers, solder mask layers, and silkscreen layers. These files comply with a 0.1 mm annular ring specification, ensuring reliable electrical connections and mechanical stability for plated through-holes (PTH) and vias.

- **Drill Files**: Drill files are provided in Excellon format, specifying precise hole locations and sizes for PTH and vias, which are critical for establishing robust electrical interconnections between layers.

The reflow soldering process utilizes a Pb-free SAC305 alloy, reaching a peak temperature of 245°C, which facilitates reliable solder joints while complying with environmental regulations regarding lead usage.

## 1.4 Key Design Validation Metrics

Ensuring the STM32 WB55CEU-based Bluetooth board meets stringent performance and reliability standards involves rigorous validation against key design metrics in power integrity, RF performance, and signal integrity.

### Power Integrity

The power integrity of the board is evaluated by monitoring the 3.3V rail ripple, which must remain at or below 50 mV peak-to-peak (mVpp) within a 20 MHz bandwidth. This criterion ensures stable power delivery to the microcontroller and peripherals, minimizing potential disruptions caused by voltage fluctuations. Additionally, the Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) is required to achieve an efficiency of at least 85% under a 100 mA load, which is indicative of effective power management and reduced energy loss during operation.

### RF Performance

The RF subsystem's performance is assessed through two primary metrics:

- **Return Loss (S11)**: The return loss must be ≤ –10 dB at 2.45 GHz, indicating that the majority of the incident power is being effectively transmitted through the antenna, with minimal reflection. This parameter is crucial for maximizing wireless communication efficiency and range.

- **Radiated Power**: In BLE transmission (Tx) mode, the board must achieve a radiated power of +3 dBm. This level of output power ensures sufficient signal strength for reliable communication within typical BLE operating ranges, balancing performance with power consumption.

### Signal Integrity

Maintaining signal integrity is paramount for the reliable operation of high-speed interfaces:

- **USB Eye Diagram**: The USB signals must comply with the USB 2.0 full-speed eye diagram mask, ensuring that the signal transitions are clean and free from excessive jitter or distortion. Compliance with this standard is essential for maintaining data transmission reliability and compatibility with USB peripherals.

- **SWD Clock Jitter**: The Serial Wire Debug (SWD) clock must exhibit jitter of ≤ 500 picoseconds (ps) at a frequency of 10 MHz. Low jitter is critical for accurate timing and synchronization during programming and debugging operations, preventing errors and ensuring precise control over the microcontroller.
