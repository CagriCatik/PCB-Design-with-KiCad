## 8. Peripherals

### 8.1 UART Interface Implementation

The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) interface serves as a fundamental communication protocol for asynchronous serial communication, facilitating firmware debugging and interfacing with external devices. The UART header on the STM32 WB55CEU-based board is meticulously designed to ensure robust and reliable data transmission, adhering to industry standards for signal integrity and protection.

- **Signal Definition:**

  The UART header comprises four primary signals, each assigned to specific pins to enable seamless data communication between the microcontroller and connected host devices.

  | Pin | Signal | Function                     |
  |-----|--------|------------------------------|
  | 1   | 3V3    | 3.3V supply (≤100 mA)         |
  | 2   | TXD    | Transmit data (MCU → host)    |
  | 3   | RXD    | Receive data (host → MCU)     |
  | 4   | GND    | Ground reference              |

- **Series Resistors (220Ω):**

  To enhance signal integrity and provide electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, each UART data line (TXD and RXD) is integrated with a 220Ω series resistor.

  - **Purpose:**
    
    The inclusion of series resistors serves a dual function:
    
    - **Current Limiting:** Protects the microcontroller's UART pins by limiting the current in the event of an ESD event or accidental short circuits.
    
    - **Impedance Matching:** When combined with host-side termination capacitors (≤50 pF load), the resistors aid in impedance matching, thereby minimizing signal reflections and ensuring clean data transmission.

  - **Power Dissipation Calculation:**

    The power dissipation ($P$) across each resistor is calculated using Ohm’s law:

    $$
    P = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{(3.3 \, \text{V})^2}{220 \, \Omega} = 49.5 \, \text{mW} \quad (\text{per resistor})
    $$

    This level of power dissipation is well within the safe operating limits of standard 220Ω resistors, ensuring reliable performance without thermal issues.

### 8.2 LED Driver Circuit

The LED driver circuit is responsible for controlling indicator LEDs, which provide visual feedback on the board’s operational status. The design ensures efficient current management and supports Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for dimming functionalities.

- **GPIO Configuration:**

  The General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins are configured to sink current, facilitating the control of LED states.

  - **Sink Current:**
    
    Each GPIO pin is configured to sink a maximum current of ≤8 mA, adhering to the STM32 WB55CEU’s GPIO specifications to prevent overloading and potential damage.

  - **Forward Current ($I_F$):**

    The forward current for the LED is calculated using the following equation:

    $$
    I_F = \frac{V_{\text{DD}} - V_F}{R} = \frac{3.3 \, \text{V} - 1.8 \, \text{V}}{220 \, \Omega} = 6.8 \, \text{mA}
    $$

    Where:
    
    - $V_{\text{DD}}$ = 3.3V (supply voltage)
    - $V_F$ = 1.8V (typical forward voltage for a green LED)
    - $R$ = 220Ω (current-limiting resistor)

    This calculation ensures that the LED operates within safe current limits, providing adequate brightness while preventing thermal and electrical stress.

  - **PWM Dimming:**
    
    PWM dimming is implemented via Timer 2 Channel 1 (TIM2_CH1) with a refresh rate of 50 Hz. This allows for smooth and flicker-free brightness control, enhancing user experience and reducing power consumption during low-light conditions.

### 8.3 Design Rules

Adhering to stringent design rules is essential for ensuring the reliability, performance, and compliance of peripheral interfaces.

- **UART Layout:**

  - **Trace Length:**
    
    The maximum trace length for the TXD and RXD pair is limited to ≤50 mm. Short trace lengths minimize signal degradation and latency, ensuring prompt and accurate data transmission.

  - **Differential Impedance:**
    
    While differential impedance is not critical for UART at speeds ≤115.2 kbps, maintaining consistent trace widths and spacing helps preserve signal integrity. The design ensures that the traces do not significantly deviate from standard impedance levels, avoiding potential reflections and crosstalk.

  - **ESD Protection:**
    
    For applications in industrial environments where exposure to ESD is more likely, an optional Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) diode (e.g., PESD5V0L1UW) can be integrated on the TXD and RXD lines. This additional protection layer further safeguards the UART interface against high-energy transient events.

- **LED Layout:**

  - **Resistor Placement:**
    
    Each current-limiting resistor (220Ω) must be placed within ≤5 mm of the LED anode. Proximity ensures effective current control and reduces the risk of signal interference.

  - **Thermal Derating:**
    
    The 220Ω resistors are selected with a power rating of ≥100 mW and are housed in an 0805 package to accommodate the calculated power dissipation of 49.5 mW. This derating provides a safety margin, preventing thermal failure under prolonged operation.

### 8.4 Signal Integrity Validation

Ensuring high signal integrity is crucial for the reliable operation of UART and LED interfaces. Validation is performed through rigorous testing to confirm adherence to design specifications.

- **UART:**

  - **Eye Diagram:**
    
    An eye diagram analysis is conducted to evaluate the quality of the UART signal. A ≥70% eye opening at 115.2 kbps ensures that the signal transitions are clear and free from excessive jitter or noise, facilitating accurate data interpretation by the receiving device.

  - **Rise Time:**
    
    The rise time of the UART signals must be ≤0.3 UI (Unit Interval), corresponding to 2.6 µs at a baud rate of 115.2 kbps. Rapid rise times are essential for minimizing bit errors and ensuring reliable communication, especially in high-speed data transfers.

- **LED:**

  - **Forward Voltage:**
    
    The forward voltage ($V_F$) of the LED is measured to be within the range of 1.65V to 1.95V at a forward current of 5 mA using a parameter analyzer. This range confirms the LED operates within its specified parameters, ensuring consistent brightness and preventing thermal overstress.

  - **PWM Linearity:**
    
    PWM dimming linearity is validated to exhibit ≤2% deviation across a duty cycle range of 10% to 90%. High linearity ensures smooth and predictable brightness transitions, enhancing the user experience and maintaining aesthetic consistency.

### 8.5 Compliance Standards

Compliance with industry standards is imperative to ensure that the peripheral interfaces operate safely and effectively within regulated environments.

- **UART:**

  - **EIA RS-232 Signal Levels:**
    
    The UART interface adheres to EIA RS-232 signal levels, utilizing 3.3V CMOS-compatible voltage levels. This compliance ensures compatibility with a wide range of serial communication devices and facilitates standardized data exchange protocols.

  - **EMC Compliance:**
    
    The UART interface meets EN 55032 Class B radiated emissions standards, maintaining emissions levels of ≤30 dBµV/m at a distance of 3 meters. This compliance minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) with other electronic devices, ensuring reliable operation in environments with multiple electronic systems.

- **LED:**

  - **Photobiological Safety:**
    
    The LED driver circuit complies with IEC 62471 photobiological safety standards, categorizing the LED as Risk Group 0. This classification ensures that the LED poses no risk of photobiological hazards to users, affirming its safety for prolonged exposure.

### 8.6 Critical Design Rules

Adherence to critical design rules ensures the structural integrity, reliability, and compliance of peripheral interfaces with established standards.

- **SWD Connector Placement:**

  Although primarily related to the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface, the following principles apply to all high-speed connectors:

  - **Proximity to MCU:**
    
    The SWD connector must be placed within ≤30 mm of the microcontroller to minimize trace inductance and preserve signal integrity. Shorter trace lengths reduce the likelihood of signal degradation and ensure timely and accurate data transmission during debugging and programming operations.

  - **Trace Routing:**
    
    High-speed signal traces should avoid crossing split planes or routing alongside high-current paths. Maintaining a clean routing environment prevents unintended coupling and EMI, safeguarding the integrity of critical signals.

- **ESD Protection:**

  - **TVS Diode Array:**
    
    To protect against ESD events, a TVS diode array (e.g., ESDALCL6-2SC6) is integrated into the peripheral interfaces. These diodes are selected to comply with IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4 standards, providing robust protection against high-energy discharges and ensuring the longevity and reliability of the USB-C and UART interfaces.
