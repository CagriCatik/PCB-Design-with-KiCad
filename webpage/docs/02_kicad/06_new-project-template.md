# Creating a New Project from a Template

In this section, we’ll focus on **creating a new project from a template** in KiCad. Templates can significantly speed up your workflow, especially when designing PCBs that follow a common structure, such as Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi expansion boards, or other standardized designs. KiCad includes several built-in templates, and you can also create your own from past projects for reuse.

## Why Use Templates?

Templates provide a pre-configured starting point for your project. They include key elements like board layouts, mounting holes, connectors, and other components that fit specific PCB standards. By using a template, you can skip the tedious initial setup steps, allowing you to focus on designing the unique aspects of your PCB.

### Benefits of Using Templates:
- **Time-Saving**: Pre-defined layouts, component placements, and board sizes.
- **Consistency**: Ensures standardized designs across multiple projects.
- **Customization**: Easily modify templates to suit specific needs.

## Steps to Create a New Project from a Template

Let’s go through the process of creating a new project from a template:

### 1. Accessing the Template Selector
- Open the **KiCad Project Manager**.
- Click on `File` → `New Project` → `New Project from Template`.
- This will bring up the **Template Selector** window, where you can choose from the available system templates or user-defined templates.

### 2. Choosing a Template
KiCad ships with a variety of built-in templates for different types of projects, including:
- **Arduino Boards**: Templates for Arduino Mini, Arduino Micro, and other common boards.
- **Raspberry Pi Expansion Boards**: Templates for designing custom add-ons or shields for Raspberry Pi models.
- **Eurocard**: Standard Eurocard-sized boards for industrial applications.

Each template comes with **documentation** and information about the elements it contains. For example, if you choose the **Raspberry Pi 40-pin expansion board** template, it will come with a pre-configured header for the GPIO pins and mounting holes aligned with the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Example: Creating a Raspberry Pi Expansion Board Project
- **Select a Template**: Let’s choose the **Raspberry Pi 40-pin Expansion Board** template.
- **Name the Project**: Enter a name like `example_new_project_from_template`.
- **Save the Project**: Ensure the option **"Create a new folder for the project"** is selected, and click **Save**.

## Exploring the Pre-Populated Project

Once the project is created, KiCad automatically generates a project directory with several pre-configured files based on the chosen template.

### 1. Project Directory Structure
Your new project folder will contain:
- **Schematic File (`.KiCad_sch`)**: Pre-populated with the Raspberry Pi header and mounting holes.
- **PCB Layout File (`.KiCad_pcb`)**: The PCB layout will already include the board outline, mounting holes, and locations for the USB and network ports.
- **Other Files**: Cache files and tables required for managing the project.

### 2. Pre-Populated Schematic
- Open the **Schematic Editor**. You’ll notice that the schematic is pre-populated with the Raspberry Pi GPIO header and basic mounting elements.
- This provides a great starting point to add your own components to interface with the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Pre-Populated PCB Layout
- Open the **PCB Editor**. The board layout is already configured with the correct dimensions and mounting holes, aligned to the Raspberry Pi’s footprint.
- The **edge cuts** (board outline) and other key features are already in place, saving you time in the setup process.

### 4. 3D Viewer
- Open the **3D Viewer** to visualize the board in 3D. You’ll see that the PCB is ready to receive components and connectors. Key mechanical features, like mounting hole locations and headers, are already positioned correctly.

## Customizing Templates

One of the most powerful features of KiCad is the ability to **create your own templates**. This is particularly useful when you have a standard design framework that you want to reuse across multiple projects. You can take an existing project, modify it, and save it as a template for future use.

### Steps to Create a Custom Template:
1. **Open an Existing Project**: Select a project that you want to convert into a template.
2. **Modify the Project**: Ensure that any reusable elements, such as board outlines, standard connectors, and mounting holes, are included.
3. **Save as Template**: You can export the project as a **user template** from the `File` menu. This will allow you to quickly start new projects using the same setup.

## Importance of Templates for Efficiency

Using templates can dramatically improve the efficiency of your workflow. Whether you are designing multiple boards that require the same physical dimensions or starting with a common set of components, templates save valuable time by eliminating repetitive tasks.

- **Standardized Components**: If you frequently use components like Arduino headers, USB connectors, or specialized ICs, templates provide a quick way to start with those elements already in place.
- **Avoiding Setup Errors**: When working with exact measurements (e.g., mounting holes, connector locations), templates ensure that your designs meet the necessary mechanical constraints from the start.

## Final Thoughts on Using Templates

Creating a new project from a template allows you to leverage pre-configured designs that speed up your workflow and reduce the chances of making errors in critical aspects such as board dimensions and component placement. In addition, creating your own templates helps ensure consistency across your designs and saves time in future projects.
